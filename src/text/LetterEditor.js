        This past semester has been fraught, to say the least. What started as a
        tensely watched &ndash; albeit distant &ndash; news story became an
        ineluctable and frightening reality for those of us in Morningside
        Heights. Though the global pandemic has undoubtedly had a differential
        impact on the economic and physical well-being of individuals in the
        Columbia community, we have all had to cope with unanticipated class
        cancellations and the indefinite suspension of in-person campus
        activities.

        Compounding individual tragedy is the dire global economic outlook. The
        limited data we have at the time of publication suggests the United
        States &ndash; like the rest of the world &ndash; is in the throes of a
        sudden and dramatic downturn. As unemployment claims climb to record
        highs, the increasingly frequent comparisons made to the Great
        Depression become more appropriate by the day.

        It is under these circumstances that we present to you the Spring 2020
        Issue of the Columbia Economic Review. It is only through the diligence
        and flexibility of our staff, editorial board, and advisor that we were
        able to publish a full issue. While the semester has been difficult,
        this has not discernibly affected our collective effort. We believe,
        unequivocally, that this edition represents the very best in
        undergraduate economics research. It demonstrates our capacity, as
        students, to make valuable contributions to the realm of academic
        inquiry.

        This issue features rigorous work in a range of topics. Though there is
        no thematic connection, they share a common sensitivity to matters of
        contemporary importance in economics, politics, and society. Noah
        Talerman (University of Michigan - Ann Arbor) examines the relationship
        between income inequality and the adoption of computer technology by
        analyzing countries&rsquo; internet penetration rates. Emily Malpass
        (Harvard University) analyzes irregularities in the market for egg
        donation as a result of adverse selection, price controls, and consumer
        preferences. Sophia Cornell (Columbia University) investigates collusion
        and other forms of anti-competitive behavior in the World Cup. Elizaveta
        Brover and Rebecca Schleimer (University of Pennsylvania) examine the
        literature on childhood disability and its impact on maternal labor
        supply. Lastly, we present an article by Shreya Ganguly (Columbia
        University&ndash;Sciences-Po), a member of the Review&rsquo;s online
        team, on the alleged right-wing bias in introductory economics courses.

        While we encountered difficulties in the publication process, we
        overcame them with the guidance and support of faculty and student body
        members. In particular, we would like to acknowledge the invaluable
        assistance of Professor Wouter Vergote, our academic advisor, Lauren
        Close, the Program Manage at the Program for Economic Research (PER),
        and Dr. Sophia N. Johnson, Assistant Director of PER. Their continued
        involvement and encouragement make CER possible.

        Lastly, we would like to offer a reflection on the coming decade. Even
        though significant uncertainties cloud the economic and social panorama,
        we know that there will be a time after this crisis. That time will give
        all of us &ndash; including us amateur economists &ndash; the
        opportunity to understand the event we are currently living through.
        While we may not know when that time will come, CER will continue to
        facilitate the probing academic work that makes sense of a complex
        world. We expect this crisis to be the topic of research for years to
        come, and we hope to begin that effort whenever sensible.
